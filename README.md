Reposetory dedicated to homeworks for VARTO School "Deme Developer" courses.
Unity Engine - 2D - URP

What I Learnd doing thos homework:
  1) Infinite level generation; Object Pool
  2) Action-Classes, which can be reused anywhere
  3) Working with UI / Canvases; Different Scenes and SceneManager

Key point to remember:
  - Each Branch is separate homework
  - Code within repository is not a final/playable project
  - Code style or patterns are NOT personal preferences, some parts of the project were done specifficaly to satisfy an assignment
  - Homework repositories DOES NOT follow Git WorkFlow, rather Feature Branch style
